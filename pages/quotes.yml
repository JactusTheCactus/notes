  - How high can you fly with broken wings?

    The bird of Hermes is my name
    Eating my wings to keep me tame
  - Speak to the dead & listen well
  - |-
    May we all rise together,
    Lest we all fall apart
  - |-
    That which is not dead can eternal lie
    And with strange æons even death may die

    Birds truly are remarkable.
    Did you know that they can sense when a thunderstorm approaches & directly seek shelter.
    They know instinctively when danger approaches.

    Do you hear any birds?
