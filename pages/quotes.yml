  - How high can you fly with broken wings?
  - |-
    The bird of Hermes is my name
    Eating my wings to keep me tame
  - Speak to the dead & listen well
  - |-
    May we all rise together,
    Lest we all fall apart
  - |-
    That which is not dead can eternal lie
    And with strange æons even death may die

    My brother, what have you done?
    You've chosen gold over blood
    When you felt the grip of the icy hand
    Did you follow fear into this land?
    My brother, what have you done?
    
    Only now do I see
    You are a stranger to me
    Did they bend your will to their command
    Or tempt you with a generous hand?
    You are a stranger to me
    You are a stranger to me
    
    And I will live with the works of my hands
    I am well aware of all that I've done and all that I am
    I will live with the choices that I've made
    Can you say the same
    Or will you carry your rеgrets 'til the end of your days?
    
    You and I arе not the same
    Despite the blood within our veins
    When they sent you to make war on me
    Did your pride foresee a victory?
    You and I are not the same
    
    What is this hate you have for me?
    Were you that easy to deceive?
    Every poison word they spoke of me
    You listened to so eagerly
    What is this hate you have for me?
    What is this hate you have for me?
    
    And I will live with the works of my hands
    I am well aware of all that I've done and all that I am
    I will live with the choices that I've made
    Can you say the same
    Or will you carry your regrets 'til the end of your days?
    
    I will live with the works of my hands
    I am well aware of all that I've done and all that I am
    I will live with the choices that I've made
    Can you say the same
    Or will you carry your regrets 'til the end of your days?"
